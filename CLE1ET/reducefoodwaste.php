				<div class="content-what">
					<p> Food is wasted mainly because of inefficient preparations, bumpy or bad roads,
					over-selective customers, and inadequate storage facilities. If storage facilities are improved and there are adequate preparations for how the food will be
					used, less food will be wasted, and there will be a more food secure community.
					As mentioned earlier, FAO reports that each year, the food wasted globally is 
					about 1.3 billion tonnes.</p>

					<h2> Top 5 ways to cut down on food waste </h2>	   
					<ul>
						<li> Don't over buy. Keep track of what you've bought and used. WRAP suggests
						taking a 'shelfie' â€“ a photo of your fridge and cupboards to remind you of what's
						there.</li>
						<li>Check the use-by dates of fresh food when you buy it. These are the dates
						to take notice of, rather than the best-before dates. Only buy what you can use
						before it expires.</li>
						<li>Plan ahead. Think about what you're going to cook and how you'll use the
						leftovers.</li>
						<li>Get to know your grocer. They will have plenty of advice on how to use up
						leftover veg.</li>
						<li>Love your freezer. Use your weekends to batch-cook and freeze. There
						are plenty of freezing tips in our guide. </li>
