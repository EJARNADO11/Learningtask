				<h1> Reduce the Risk of Commercialisng </h1>
				<div class="content-what">
					<p> If food is grown for the purposes of feeding the community or nation, food
					insecurity levels will go down. Farmers can produce more food crops and will be
					able to produce cash crops when there are enough food crops in the market.
					There will be less risk of commercialization of food if it is sufficient in the
					market. Governments should also implement programs that can allow farmers
					to know when there is sufficient food for everyone.</p>

					<h2> Three ways to reduce the risk of commercialising new products and services </h2>	   
					<ol>
						<li> Incorporate customer insights early and often
						<br> <br>
						Many ideas and technologies fail because the user didn’t like or want the product. Without a thorough understanding of your customers, thesuccess of your new product or service relies on pure luck – you might as well flip a coin. Research your target market, speak to your potential customers, and seek their feedback. You will need to do this at multiple points during the commercialisation process.</li>
						<br> <br>
						<li> Only the best allowed to progress
						<br> <br>
						 It is true that in the ideation stage, the more ideas the better. However, as you move past this ‘fuzzy front-end’ and through to the implementation stage, a structured stage-gate progression process is required. The process must be designed to ensure ideas are tested so only the most suitable move through to the more time and resource-intensive implementation stage. Failing to vet ideas thoroughly can result in your innovation program becoming a costly time-sink with minimal profitable outcomes. Have a process to identify the best ideas and focus your efforts on progressing those.</li>
					    <br> 
						<li> Measure and report
						<br> <br>
						It is important to establish a framework to measure performance for reporting and accountability at key stages in the commercialisation process. This will help keep everyone involved in the project on track and provide an early-warning system if the project is beginning to go over budget or off schedule. </li>
